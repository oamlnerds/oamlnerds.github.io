### THE CORONAVIRUS
The coronavirus, specifically COVID-19; has been going around killing millions. So far, the total number of people infected in Alaska are 12! So, far the estimate of totoal deaths in America (now and in the future) is about 1 million people (34% of the population). Spring break has been extended untill the end of March, March 30th. Word has gone around that the Sitka School District will be providing free meals during this emergency. The District may also have to provide online classes instead of face to face classes. Because some students might not have acess to the internet or computers, the school district might hand out computers to students, and GCI would provide free WiFi. Another issue that has come up with the virus is barges and barging. Because of security to stop the spread of the virus, certin barges have been banned. When people heard this they panicked. The whole shelf of toilet paper is gone now! One lady asked the store if she could buy all the beef in the store; $3000 worth of beef! There was barely any flour left when I went to the store, so by now they are probobly all gone! Please Pray for the world.
