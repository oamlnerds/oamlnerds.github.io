Future Problem solvers are students who are given a scenario, identify 16 challenges in the scenario, pick one and write a UP, develop 16 solutions, write a critira and grid to pick the best solution, and finally write an action plan. It's hard work, but in the end it's worth it. We are the Sitka Future Problem Solvers!

Go Sitka!!!
