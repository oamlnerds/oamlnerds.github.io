# FPS

Future Problem solvers are students who are given a scenario, identify 16 challenges in the scenario, pick one and write a UP, develop 16 solutions, write a critira and grid to pick the best solution, and finally write an action plan. It's hard work, but in the end it's worth it.

Go Sitka!!!
