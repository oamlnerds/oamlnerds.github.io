### How to Properly Train a Cat to Walk on a Leash

**By Angela** | May 28th, 2021


When people hear about walking a cat on a leash, they might laugh, be suprised, or think it's impossible. It is true though that dogs have been domesticated for more time than cats, so walking a cat might be a generally new idea. However, it can be done. With these steps provided, you can have your cat walking on a leash in only a few months!


**Step 1**: Comfortability


The most important thing when training a cat to walk on a leash is to make sure they are comfortable, emotionally, and physically. First we will talk about getting a harness suited for your cat. Then we will talk about ways you can help your cat to learn faster.


I. Experiencing the Outdoors Inside


Before you even want to think about walking your cat outside, you need to make sure that she/he enjoys the outdoors. If you have a cat who never liked the idea of going out of it's den (home), it will be a much more difficult process. If your cat applies to this, you might want to reconsider taking it on walks. That being said though, whenever a cat is exposed to a new environment it might take time to enjoy it. To let she/he find out how it feels about going outside, leave little opportunities for she/he to explore. Examples can include leaving the door open a crack, or opening a window (be careful not to let them escape). If your cat is attracted to these things, it may want to go outside. 

II. The Harness


Getting the right type of harness is one of the most important steps to getting a cat walking. You should never connect a leash to a collar for a cat, as sometimes they lurch forward. If this does happen with only a collar and a leash, the chances of choking your furbaby is quite high. A harness is a much better option for cats, but you will still need to pick the right size and type that matches your cat best. If you are unsure of a good harness, here is a link to a great one I use for my two cats: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Harness-Walking-Adjustable-Reflective-Comfort/dp/B07Z666T5N/ref=sr_1_3_sspa?dchild=1&keywords=cat%2Bharness&qid=1622343240&sr=8-3-spons&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUFSN0wzWFI0WEVFUUwmZW5jcnlwdGVkSWQ9QTA0MjQ2ODExV1hBRDQwTzIwM0g5JmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTA2ODA3NzQzS0cyTURDUDE0RzJJJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfYXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ&th=1">Supet Cat Harness</a>. Another great harness link is here too: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Harness-Leash-Walking-Escape-Inches/dp/B07SC7WFQN/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=cat+harness&qid=1622343510&sr=8-1">rabbitgoo Cat Harness</a>.

Once you have recived the harness, show it to your cat. Do NOT put it on your cat immidiately, this can implant a related negetive feeling in your cat's mind. Instead, let your cat smell it, and offer treats whenever she/he's around it. You should also put the harness on top of your cat without putting it on, while still offering treats and encoragement. This can construct postive feelings for your cat. You should repeat this daily for 1 week (This is the suggested time, but if you think your cat is ready you can repeat for only a few days).

*Note on Step 1:* If your cat is showing any signs of anger, you may want to take a break or stop the training to avoid future problems.
**Step 2**: Putting the Harness on
