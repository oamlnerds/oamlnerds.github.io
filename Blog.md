### How to Properly Train a Cat to Walk on a Leash

**By Angela** | May 28th, 2021


When people hear about walking a cat on a leash, they might laugh, be suprised, or think it's impossible. It is true though that dogs have been domesticated for more time than cats, so walking a cat might be a generally new idea. However, it can be done. With these steps provided, you can have your cat walking on a leash in only a few months!


**Step 1**: Comfortability


The most important thing when training a cat to walk on a leash is to make sure they are comfortable, emotionally, and physically. First we will talk about getting a harness suited for your cat. Then we will talk about ways you can help your cat to learn faster.


The Harness


Getting the right type of harness is one of the most important steps to getting a cat walking. You should never connect a leash to a collar for a cat, as sometimes they lurch forward. If this does happen with only a collar and a leash, the chances of choking your furbaby is quite high. A harness is a much better option for cats, but you will still need to pick the right size and type that matches your cat best. If you are unsure of a good harness, here is a link to a great one I use for my two cats: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Harness-Walking-Adjustable-Reflective-Comfort/dp/B07Z666T5N/ref=sr_1_3_sspa?dchild=1&keywords=cat%2Bharness&qid=1622343240&sr=8-3-spons&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUFSN0wzWFI0WEVFUUwmZW5jcnlwdGVkSWQ9QTA0MjQ2ODExV1hBRDQwTzIwM0g5JmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTA2ODA3NzQzS0cyTURDUDE0RzJJJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfYXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ&th=1">Supet Cat Harness</a>.
