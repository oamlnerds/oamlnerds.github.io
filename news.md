## JULY NEWS

Hello. This is Leilynn with the July news report. Recently limits for salmon in Sitka has gone up from 1 to 3. While that might make everyone happy now, soon we will all be sick and tired of fish. Although, it will provide lots of chances for people to see bears get in to their fishy smelling garbage cans! More good ocean news is that the whale population is increasing yearly by 8.4 % and there are an estimated 15,000 whales in the ocean right as we speak. 
Even though many things have been canceled due to Covid-19, the annual Forth of July fireworks will go on thanks to the Hames Corporation. Get ready for amazing lights and loud noises well past midnight! In place of the usual parade, there will be an older cars parade that will go down all the back roads to help with social distancing. Bring your mask! The parade will start at whale park. There will still be food stands (Angela can you double check that I only heard that from one person) but don’t eat to much. So, this concludes the July news report the next update will be next month so until then don’t get sick.
