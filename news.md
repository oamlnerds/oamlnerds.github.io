## JULY NEWS

Hi to the few people in the world ever to read this. This is Leilynn with the October news. Boring thing first. The weather report for 10/5 though 10/9 is rain and rain. Then scattered showers and foggy rain. Then partly sunny and (you guessed it) chance of rain. Now that that's out of the way we can get on to the interesting stuff. Firstly (according to KCAW) there will still be the downtown trick-or-treating as usual. Mask are required. The 3-5 preschools annual pumpkin patch will also be happening. Whether the Alaska Day celebrations will go on remains to be seen.
