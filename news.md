## DECEMBER NEWS

Happy holidays! This is Leilynn with the December New report. Let's start off with the holidays. This year Hanukkah starts on December, 10th and ends on the 18th. Kwanzaa Starts on Saturday December, 26. National Cookie Day is on the 8th and Christmas will be on the the 25 as always. Get out your candles, Dreidels, and trees! The rain has finally stopped here in southeast but (at the time of writing) with no snow in the forecast to most everyone's disappointment. However there might be more rain in the near future. Rain gear and umbrellas highly recommended. Hunting has not be very good lately with some people saying that the runt has not even started yet. That concludes the December new report.
